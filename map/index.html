        <p>Our boreal forest adventure began in this village about 750 kilometres northwest of Montreal. A mining and sawmill town, Matagami is gateway to James Bay. Good place to get gas, groceries and guns.

        <h3>Title two</h3>
        <p>We slept two nights in hunting camps with plywood walls of the Crees Robbie and Annie Saganash and their son, Stanley. We carried water from Lake Quenonisca to wash dishes. Loggers worked near the camp. We slaughtered a moose and ate it.
